This package integrates [Tenor GIF search](https://tenor.com/) into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) by utilizing the [tenor_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/tenor_dart) package to communicate directly with the [Tenor API V2](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart) via [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http).

The package currently provides an opinionated yet customizable UI experience for searching and selecting from a list of GIFs/Stickers from the Tenor GIF search API.

## What to know

- In order to start using Tenor Flutter you must obtain an API key by registering your project with [Tenor](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart).
- Tenor requires proper [attribution](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/attribution) for projects using their API. This package enables "Powered By Tenor" and "Search Tenor" by default. You are only required to have one.

## Obtaining Tenor API v2 key

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a [new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
3. Go to the Google Cloud Marketplace and find the [Tenor API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/tenor.googleapis.com)
4. Click `Enable` to activate it
5. In the navigation menu, go to the `APIs & Services` tab and select [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
6. Click `+ Create Credentials` and choose `API key`
7. Copy the generated API key
8. Provide this API key as a parameter to `Tenor(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY')`

## Usage

### Installation

```
flutter pub add tenor_flutter
```

<sup>Having trouble? Read the pub.dev <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/tenor_flutter/install">installation page</a>.</sup>

### Import

Import the package into the dart file where it will be used:

```
import 'package:tenor_flutter/tenor_flutter.dart';
```

### Initialize

You must pass in a valid `apiKey` provided by [Tenor](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart). It's **strongly recommended** to also pass in a `clientKey` as this will help you distinguish which project is making the requests.

```
final tenorClient = Tenor(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', clientKey: 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME');
```

## Example

For more elaborate examples feel free to check out [example/lib/main.dart](https://github.com/Flyclops/tenor_flutter/blob/main/example/lib/main.dart).

Here's how to display the UI as a bottom sheet and then print the user's selection. If `null` is returned, it means the user closed the sheet without choosing a GIF.

```
final tenorClient = Tenor(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', clientKey: 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME');
final TenorResult? result = await tenorClient.showAsBottomSheet(context: context);
print(result?.media.tinyGif?.url);
```

## Don't need the UI?

If you're seeking a solution that allows for full customization without the need of dependencies then consider [Tenor Dart](https://github.com/Flyclops/tenor_dart).
